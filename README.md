# React SSR Example

This project contains a vanilla React Server Side Rendered (SSR) Application with a mini router
implementation to help illustrate how React SSR works under the hood. It also contains a minimal
vanilla Webpack setup.

- To run a webpack dev server do `npm run dev`
- To generate a bundle for SSR serving do `npm run build`
- To start a SSR server do `npm run serve` after that
